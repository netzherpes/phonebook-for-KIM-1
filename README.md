It simply saved lines of text from 0200 or 2000 on, depending on the version. The original Version (start $0077) has some nasty errors though. I tried to fix some things in the imroved version (start $0200)<br>
The interesting part is the search function, where you can querry a phrase, a name, a number and the program will spit out the line of text containing this phrase. The first letter is sadly not written. Still investigating. But it's there ;) 

Switch Data entry / data querry with "esc" <br>
You start with data querry. and a question mark.<br>

After switching to data entry you can write whatever you want, up to 255 chars. End your line with (ENTER). **Important: Start your very first enrty with an (Enter), too!**<br>
